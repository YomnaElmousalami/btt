The goal of this exercise was to use a logistic regression model to predict the "host_is_superhost" binary label, use grid search to find the optimal
logistic regression hyperparameters, test the model based on the optimized hyperparameters, plot precision-recall, ROC, and AUC curves for both the optimimized and unoptimized models,
and make the model persistent using pickle.
